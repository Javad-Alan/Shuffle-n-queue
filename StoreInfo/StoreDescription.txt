Want to just shuffle and play the music on your phone? 
Annoyed with the default music players that put page after page of useless stuff between you and your songs? 
Here you go, a super-simple music player. 

It'll play your songs in random order. 
It can play all songs or just the songs from a playlist.
You pick a song to start with and it'll take it from there.
That's all.

If you are after:
 * info about bands
 * album artwork
 * recommendations for other music you'd like
 * tour dates
 * and other extras that suck your data allowance and distract from the music 
then you need to look elsewhere.
